        "When Malaysian songstress Yuna came to New York for her first press tour, I worked with her label to create a slate of video content about her New York debut. I created a series of short interview videos to promote her songwriting, collaborations and style. I also documented her New York debut concert, including a glowing introduction by Pharrell (the pair collaborated on her debut single \"Life Your Life\".)"
