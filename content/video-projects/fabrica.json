    "Fabrica Research Centre is a residency for creative talents based in Treviso, Italy.",
    "As a resident of Fabrica from 2014-2015, I was a video producer in the product design studio. I produced content for the studio, including a documentary short about the creative process for Moleskine. I collaborated with other residents on personal projects, like the animation \"Peeing Cloud\", and the documentary \"Profile of a Musician\", and the behind the scenes of \"Usually Nowhere\". I also worked with filmmakers in the editorial studio on projects, including \"Waiting for the Gods\" by Natalie Welsh and Alessandro Bertelle."
